> [!IMPORTANT]
> The program can now intelligently suggest which window to play music in. Playback stops when you focus on another window. This prevents unwanted shortcuts from being triggered by random keystrokes. If your game window doesn't appear in the list, please contact me. There may be issues with other languages.

### To change the language selection or key selection:
* Run the `reset key layouts.py` file.



## How to add other sheet musics to the list?
